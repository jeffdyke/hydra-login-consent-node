data flow with commentary. So Claude or any client will send a request to the server that it was informed about. In this case, it's auth.staging.bonlink.org. And it will first look for a slash dot well-known file so it can find out the internals of where the endpoints are. And that's going to direct it to a slash OAuth2 slash auth on the domain of auth.staging.bondlink.org. So the application needs that information that it's going to send to slash oauth to slash auth, yet it is effectively part of the spec that it's made to go directly to the authenticator. So for that reason, HTTP proxy middleware was added. And the idea is that I take all of the challenge data on the way in and store it in Redis and then strip out. So the request comes in in pixie format. which is a one-way hash doesn't really matter for this And the application is the only one that needs to authenticate that and not Hydra. Hydra doesn't need to know anything about it.

So as we proxy the request, we take all of the challenge data out, store it in Redis, and strip out the code challenge and code challenge method. And then we go through the Hydra process, sorry, the Hydra authentication process. So this is actually sending to the internal address of the Hydra public URI as proxied from within Express. So at that point, once it's accepted, and again, it knows nothing about the PXE validation, like that's completely on the application side. but it'll send the auth and it'll get a redirect to login challenge. That login challenge will be applied and accepted as long as the session is valid. That gets sent to a consent screen. The consent screen is Again, using the Hydra admin directly through its API, contacting the actual Hydra service, or accepting these login challenge, consent challenges, which are Google's consent challenge.

And then once all of those challenges are done, and that's part of just Hydra's OAuth flow, like that's really what using this software is giving us. So once that is all done, And we've already sent authentication to Google, and that's how we got into the Google redirect flow. And when, after the consent is accepted, our local callback is called, which is auth.staging.bondlink.org slash callback. And we process the challenge data at the state that it's in right now. So we're aware of the state it was given to us. We're aware of the text and the method and have our own verifier. And as long as that is successful, we ask for a generic and rather bland token from Hydra. And then as soon as that is granted, again, like all the validation is happening in the application itself outside of Hydra. But as soon as Hydra gives us that token, we can turn around and request the final OAuth from Google that will have the redirect URI of Claude or whatever client we have chosen.

and it will complete the exchange as long as the challenge and the state are met. You pass those back for validation. Man, I hope this is useful.
